Hey, I'm M4x1m3, yet another random french dev. I made this blog to post about my different projects and dev-related experiment, both software and hardware.

### Projects

- [Omega](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega) a custom firmware for the Numworks calculator.
- [Omega-website](https://github.com/Omega-Numworks/Omega-website) a website and one click installer for Omega.
- [GreenPhoenix](https://github.com/M4xi1m3/GreenPhoenix) a Minecraft Alpha 1.2.6 server, written from scratch in C++ (WIP).
- [CoffeeLeaf](https://github.com/M4xi1m3/coffeeleaf) a PlantUML diagrams generator, taking java code as an input (WIP).
